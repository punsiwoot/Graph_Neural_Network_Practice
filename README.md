# Graph_Neural_Network_Practice
 this is my code when learning graph neural network

 ## Graph Convolutional
 ### simple_GCN
 this process is a message aggreation and pass through a liner layer
 if these process repeat N time it will mean having N layer of GCN all of 
 these will output a embeding of Graph structure+feature and the last layer will be linear layer to classifire a node

 * first embeding before train process

 * last embeding after train process
